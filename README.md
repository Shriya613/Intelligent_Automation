# Intelligent_Automation

This Presentation on Intelligent Automation gives a brief on what IA is, how it works, it's use cases, challenges, applications and how it is advancing in the tech world.

Intelligent automation (IA) — an end-to-end intelligent automation solution that combines robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI) — can provide many benefits that aid in the digital transformation of an organization.

AI is the perfect complement to RPA, together providing more accurate and efficient automation powered by an informed knowledge base. AI is the process behind the effort to simulate human intelligence in machines, while RPA automates processes that use structured data and logic.
